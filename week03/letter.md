Dear school community,

First we would like to stress the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic and recognize the ongoing concern about the continued community spread of the coronavirus. These concerns have led some organization to adopt digital contact tracing apps that will notify individuals of their potential exposure to an infected individual. 
As a school community we have decided against adopting such measure and would like to share our reasoning. We are concerned about the data collection, possible security breaches, or sale of data to 3rd party entities. This is especially concerning given the fact that most of our school community are minors and need to be particularly protected.

* While the data is anonymized, multiple reports have show that anonymized data can be easily be traced to individuals. See [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/health/data-privacy-protection.html) for more. 
* These apps have been developed by for profit companies and their security measures have not been audited by third party organization. 
* Many of these apps require permissions that are of concern, including access to a device's camera, microphone, and files. This raises concern about why the companies are requesting this level of access.
* The combination of permission levels and lack of security oversight makes these apps particularly worrisome of they were to be the target of a hack.
* For this is be an effective counter measure to community spread, 100% compliance within our school community would be required. This raises issues of equity, as not all of the members of our community have smartphones.
* As a school, we are concerned about the legality of requesting individuals to install apps on their private devices.

We believe the strongest deterrent to community spread remains wearing high quality masks and continue to suggest this to all members of our community. 

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.

Sincerely,
School Staff
