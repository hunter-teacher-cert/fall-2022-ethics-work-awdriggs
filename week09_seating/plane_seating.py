##Next Steps: 

# Uncomment out our determine_avail_seats_row function -- that will calculate how many seats are available in each row
# We will use our sorted key dictionary (economy_sorted) to look at the largest groups first
# We will seat groups of 10 (3/3/2/2), 9 (3/3/3), 8 (3/3/2), 7 (3/2/2), 6 (3/3/3), 5 (3/2), 4 (2/2), 3, 2, 1
    # This will be done by splitting up the group based on the total number and then finding associated availabile seats
# Groups will be sorted from the front of the plane to the back.
