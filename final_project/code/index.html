    <h1 id="main-title">Gamification</h1>

    <p>Gamification is when game mechanics are applied to non-game, non-entertainment purposes. This often means adding points, badges, leaderboards, levels and quests to non-game activities.</p>

    <p>Gamification has been applied to many different types of websites and apps. Everything from fitness trackers like <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/close-your-rings/" target="_blank">Apple's Fitness Rings</a> to apps like <a href="http://www.chorewars.com/" target="_blank">Chore Wars</a> which makes a doing household chores into a game like activity.</p>

    <p>At its best, gamification is thought to increase motivation. At its worse it can be used to manipulate people into changing their behaviors by adding incentives like points and prizes. For example, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/02/technology/uber-drivers-psychological-tricks.html" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> describes how Uber has used gamification to get drivers to drive more trips.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this website is to experience "generic gamification." Points and badges have been added to increase your motivation to learn more about gamification. Does it work for you?</p>

    <p>Let's Get Started</p>


    <h2>Click Game</h2>

    <p>Clicking is one of the most basic actions we do online. But what happens if this act was gamified? Does it change how many times you click?</p>

    <div id='p5-container'>
    </div>
    <!-- this is to stop the click game from highlighting all the text -->
    <br class="hide">

    <p>This is a simplified clone of Cookie Clicker, originally created as a website in 2013, it is being downloaded on Steam over 1.1 million times. That is a lot of clicks!</p>
     
    <h2>Gamification Everywhere</h2>
    <p>In 2010, a talk by Jesse Schelle at the DICE conference titled "When Games Invade Real Life" which laid out the possibility of gamification when applied to anything and everything.</p>

    <p>Full video <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jesse_schell_when_games_invade_real_life" target="_black">here</a></p>
    <p>While this reality has yet to come to pass, we can see elements in apps that have become commonplace.</p> 

    <h2>Gamification in Schools</h2>

    <p>Gamification in schools is not really new. Classroom points, star stickers, and award certificates all existed before the idea of gamification.</p>
    <img class="stretch" src="./assets/hp-points.gif">
    <p>With apps and the internet, gamification in schools as reached a higher level. <a href="https://www.classdojo.com/" target="_blank">Class Dojo</a> is a classroom tool that was created in 2011 and was widely adopted by schools and teachers, in part because it was free! You can thank private equity for that, which allowed Class Dojo to grow without the typical educational purchasing process. When it launched one of the most popular features is the points, which allow teachers to award points to students for behaviors and take away points for undesireable behavior, thus gamifying a students motivation to behave in class.</p>

    <p><a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank">Kahoot</a> and <a href="https://quizlet.com/" target="_blank">Quizlet</a> allow teachers to create quiz that students can compete on. A leaderboard, sound effects, and confetti make the classroom into a game show. While this works to motivate some students, usually the ones that are already doing wellr. For other students these experiences can be demoralizing and disengaging.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> built generic gamification into their site. Students adopt an avatar, earn "Energy Points," and are awarded badges. Listen here to one of the sites designers describe how gamifcation motivates students on the site.</P>

    <p>The problem with these approaches is they work through extrinsic motivation, giving awards for different behaviors. In theory this should motivate students to learn but as we'll see in the next section, it is unclear how long lasting any such benefits are.</p>   

    <h2>What the Research Says</h2>

    <p>The promise of gamification is often used as a selling point for its adoption. According to <a href="https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-017-0042-5" target="_blank">Dichev and Dicheva</a> “There are several assumptions underlying the usefulness of gamification in educational context, such as gamification is motivating, gamification is engaging, gamification can improve attendance and participation. However, research remains inconclusive on these assumptions”</p>

    <p>As shown in research from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563215002265" target="_blank">Junoh Hamari</a>, while studies have shown increases in student interest and outcomes, it is unclear if these initial outcomes are due to authentic improvement or largely due to the novelty of a specific element, which may wane over time.</p>

    <p>Contrary to the idea that gamification will inevitably improve education, as more research is conducted, there is growing concern against the efficacy of gamification in schools. As <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131514002000" target="_blank">Hanus and Fox</a> have written, “The increased social comparison, competition, and reward systems might have detrimental effects over the long term for students' motivation, satisfaction, enjoyment, and engagement with class material”</p>

    <h2>Improving Gamification</h2>

    <p>While research of gamification in education is still developing and inconclusive, there are considerations for implementing gamification into the classroom. <a href="https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-017-0042-5" target="_blank">Dichev and Dicheva</a> have written that gamification is more successful if implemented with a carefully thought out and thorough approach; simple badges and gimmicks do not produce the types of results touted by most gamified educational apps. A well-designed gamification system can help players take on meaningful roles that are fruitful for learning. Badges and points can not simply slapped onto any content and be successfully gamified.</p>

    <p>Gamification lends itself to places in the classroom where students need practice without fear of failure, as well as exposure to tasks that can be broken down and where "performance is measurable," an area of research that is still lacking according to <a href="https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-017-0042-5" target="_blank">Dichev and Dicheva</a>.</p>
